= Java Bytecode Inspector

This project allows a quick way to inspect the class versions of either a jar file or all jar files in a directory.

Set the arguments as a command line argument:

`gradlew run -Pargs=<file>`

where file is either a jar file or directory, or edit the build.gradle file and set the `defaultArgs` property and run:

`gradlew run`
